=head1 NAME

Encode::Wechsler - Just another Wechsler encoder/decoder

THIS MODULE IS AN ALPHA RELEASE!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Object oriented interface:

  use Encode::Wechsler;

  my $wechsler = Encode::Wechsler->new;
  my @array  = $wechsler->decode( 'xp3_0ggmligkcz32w46' );
  my $string = scalar $wechsler->decode( 'xp3_0ggmligkcz32w46' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Wechsler encoding is used to describe game boards for Conway's Game of Life.

THIS MODULE IS AN ALPHA RELEASE!

Interface will most likely change. Also, there is no encode() method for this
release. This release only provides decode(). No procedural interface is currently
available but should be in a future release, as well as an encode() method.
(The author's current needs only require decoding.) :D

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new( %params )>

  my $wechsler = Encode::Wechsler->new();

Constructs object. Accepts the following named parameters:

=back

=over 8

=item * C<pad>

Integer. Ensure resulting game grid has empty cells on all four edges: the top
and bottom rows and left most and right most columns will all be "turned off."
The amount of padding determines how many rows/cols of padding will be added.

  my $wechsler = Encode::Wechsler->new( pad => 4 );

Some codes require additional padding in order to sustain properly.

=back

=over 4

=item C<encode( $string or $array_ref )>

Not currently implemented.

=item C<decode( $string )>

Attempts to decode the string argument. Returns a list of array references (2d array)
when called in list context:

  my @array  = $wechsler->decode( 'xp3_0ggmligkcz32w46' );

Or returns a text representation of the game board in scalar context:

  my $string = scalar $wechsler->decode( 'xp3_0ggmligkcz32w46' );

Throws exception if code is invalid.
